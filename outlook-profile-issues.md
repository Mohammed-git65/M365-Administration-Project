If you work in IT support, you've likely encountered the classic scenario:  
A user says _"Outlook isn’t working,"_ and you instinctively know — it’s going to be a profile-related issue.

Here are three of the most frequent Outlook profile problems I’ve resolved — and how to fix them efficiently:

Outlook freezes on startup with the message **“Loading Profile.”**

**Fix:**

2. Go to `Mail` → `Show Profiles`

## 🔹 2. Unable to Send or Receive Emails  
(_Typically after a migration or password change_)

**Symptoms:**  
User can't send or receive emails, especially following:
