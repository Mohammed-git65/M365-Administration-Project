**Introduction**

In today's digital age, the protection of sensitive information is paramount for organizations. Email remains a primary communication tool, but it also poses significant risks for data breaches and leaks. This project focuses on implementing robust email security measures to prevent the transmission of sensitive data, specifically credit card numbers, through outbound emails. By leveraging mail flow rules, data loss prevention (DLP) policies, and other security mechanisms, the company aims to safeguard its information assets and comply with regulatory requirements.

**Statement of the Problem**

The company faces a critical challenge in preventing the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive information, particularly credit card numbers, via email. Despite existing security protocols, there is a risk that employees may inadvertently or maliciously send emails containing credit card information, leading to potential data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement effective measures to detect and block such sensitive data in outbound emails.

**Objectives**

1. Create Mail Flow Rules: Develop and configure mail flow rules to inspect and block emails containing credit card numbers.
2. Set Up Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies: Implement DLP policies to prevent the leakage of sensitive information and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
3. Implement Email Disclaimers: Add disclaimers to outbound emails to inform recipients about the company's data protection policies and disclaim liability for unauthorized data sharing.
4. Configure Auto-Forwarding Rules: Set up rules to manage and control the auto-forwarding of emails to external recipients, ensuring sensitive data is not inadvertently shared.
5. Test and Monitor Effectiveness: Conduct thorough testing of the implemented rules and policies to ensure their effectiveness and monitor their performance over time.

**Step 5: Test and Monitor Rule Effectiveness**

1. Test the Rules:
- Send test emails containing credit card numbers to verify that the rules are working as expected.
- Check if the emails are blocked and if the notifications are sent.

2. Monitor Rule Effectiveness:

- Use the Mail flow > Reports section in the Exchange Admin Center to monitor the effectiveness of the rules.
- Review the logs and reports to ensure that the rules are correctly identifying and blocking sensitive information
